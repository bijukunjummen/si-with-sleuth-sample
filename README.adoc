Spring Integration with Java DSL support to send and process "Work Units" with a RabbitMQ broker mediating the transfer

== Steps

* Start RabbitMQ server:

[source]
----
rabbitmq-server
----

* Start Zipkin

[source]
----
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
----

* Verify Zipkin url in work-dispatcher/src/main/resources/application.properties and work-handler/src/main/resources/application.properties

[source]
----
spring.zipkin.base-url=http://192.168.99.100:9411/
----


* Start the Work Handler:

[source]
----
cd work-handler
mvn spring-boot:run
----

* Start the Work Dispatcher:

[source]
----
cd work-dispatcher
mvn spring-boot:run
----


* Create dummy work units by calling a controller endpoint:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/generateWork?id=1&definition=test&throw_exception=false
----

* A throw exception flag will cause the "Work Unit" processor to throw an error. If that happens a complex flow is kicked off -

- There is a Dead Letter exchange configured for the Work unit queue, the message from the dead letter exchange is routed to
the Dead letter queue, dead letter queue has a ttl of 20 seconds and in-turn has the dead letter exchange configured to be the work units queue thus creating a nice cycle.
The cycle of consuming messages is broken by adding in a filter in the processing flow to break processing after a set number of retries - 3 in this case.
